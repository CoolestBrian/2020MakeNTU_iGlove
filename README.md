A project done in 2020 Make NTU

### Motivation

We're students from National Taiwan University Department of Electrical Engineering. At school, we usually use bicycle as our transportation, and it often rain in Taiwan, which make us frustrating when we have to lock/unlock our bicycle, so we want to invent a wearable device to solve this problem and can easily control different device using different gesture to make our life easier.

###Design

We use MediaTek Cloud Sandbox (MCS) as a data storge platform, Linkit 7697 as EVB, MPU6050 as triple Axis Accelerometer and Gyro,

###Prospect

1.More functions can be added, customized gesture by ML method
2.User friendly interface(ex. app,website...)
3.A much concise device by using high-tech material, better performance can be shown
